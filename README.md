# Solidity Smart Contract Project â€” Foundry + Cyfrin Course

This repository contains my first professional Solidity project built while following **Patrick Collins' Cyfrin Foundry & Smart Contract Development Course**.  
It serves as both a **learning sandbox** and the foundation for my journey into **smart contract auditing** and **DeFi security**.

---

## ðŸš€ About the Project

This project is a hands-on implementation of Ethereum smart contracts using **Foundry**, a fast and modern toolkit for Solidity development.  
I am building, testing, and deploying contracts while applying professional development workflows such as **version control, gas optimization, and security best practices**.

Key goals for this project:
- Learn and apply **Solidity fundamentals** in a professional environment.
- Use **Foundry** for development, testing, and deployment.
- Practice **secure smart contract patterns**.
- Prepare for **real-world DeFi auditing** work.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Foundry** (Forge, Cast, Anvil, Chisel)
- **Solidity** (^0.8.x)
- **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**
- **GitHub** for version control & collaboration

## ðŸ“¦ Foundry Toolkit Overview

- **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Hardhat/Truffle).
- **Cast**: CLI tool for interacting with contracts & sending transactions.
- **Anvil**: Local Ethereum test node.
- **Chisel**: Solidity REPL for quick experiments.
